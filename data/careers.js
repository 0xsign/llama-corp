          What we value the most is speed of execution, and we actively try to remove anything extraneous or not needed.

        <p>
          This creates an environment where we instantly extend a lot of trust to everyone (we just trust that they are actively working, we won't micro-manage to make sure you do X hours on Y days), and the following people thrive:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You want to get involved in a new project with high growth prospects and plenty of responsibilities</li>
          <li>You enjoy having full control over your work and the tools you use.</li>
          <li>You enjoy making a large impact</li>
          <li>You have strong initiative, if you identify something that could be improved you just go and improve it</li>
          <li>You want to stop wasting time on things like meetings and stuff that doesn't matter and instead prefer having full and un-interrupted control of your time</li>

        <ul>
          <li>We don't micro-manage so team members are expected to do their work as requested and meet their deadlines. They are trusted to deliver and self-manage.</li>
          <li>You have low intrinsic motivation: Most people at LlamaFolio work independently, so if you don't have a strong intrinsic motivation it's very likely you'll get demotivated and stop working.</li>
